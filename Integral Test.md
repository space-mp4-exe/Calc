The test is defined as if $f$ is continous, positive, and decreasing on $[1,\infty)$, then $\sum a_{n}$ converges if $\int^{\infty}_{1}f(x)dx$ converges, it also diverges if the also integral diverges.
**Remainder** is defined as
$$R_{N} = S - S_{N}$$ In more common terms: the remainder is the deference between the *partial sum*($S_{N}$)and the *infinite sum*($S$) of the series.
