This is a geometric series:
$$\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}ar^{n-1}$$
This series is convergent when $|r| < 1$.

This is a P-series:
$$\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n^p}$$

This series is convergent when $p > 1$.  
$$\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n}$$

is divergent because it is something called the harmonic series.
We can find what value the geometric series converges to with this formula:
$$\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}ar^{n-1} = \frac{a}{1-r}$$
