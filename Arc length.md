# Velocity
if $r(t) = <f(t), g(t), h(t)>$ is a distance vector, it returns the position of the point at time $t$. Then the derivative $r'(t) = <f'(t), g'(t), h'(t)>$ would be the *velocity vector*, the magnitude ($\mid r'(t) \mid$) of this vector would be the speed of the point at time $t$. 
# Distance
to find the distance traveled along the curve, simple take the integral of $r(t)$. $$\int r(t)= \int<f(t), g(t), h(t)>\, dt $$
# Curvature 
Curvature is represented by kappa, $\kappa$. 
$$\kappa(t) = \frac{\mid r' \times r'' \mid}{\mid r' \mid ^3} = \frac{1}{\mathrm{radius \; of\;curvatu\mathrm{re}}}$$
